# OS_Prog4

The final programming assignment is to write an OS simulation program.  

Required elements:

    Simulation of the process scheduler with Round Robin, Priority, Shortest Job First.
        Using processes entering the queue, user selected time quanta / parameters, generate the Gantt chart.
    Simulation of the memory management unit, TLB, page tables and paging.
        The user will enter the memory size (number of frames) and the address size (number of pages).
        The user will select the details about the paging unit (TLB size).
        Using a reasonable model for memory accesses, demonstrate graphically how the memory access occurs.  Compute effective memory access time due to TLB hits/misses.  
    Simulation of the page replacement algorithms FIFO, Optimal, LRU, LFU, NRU. 
        Use auto-generated reference strings.
        The user will select the algorithm, number of frames, and reference string details.  
        Output page faults.
    Cross platform GUI interface.
